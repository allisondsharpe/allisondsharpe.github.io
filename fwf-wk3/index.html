                <h3> What is Backbone? </h3>
                <p> Backbone or Backbone.js is a Front-End Javascript framework that makes designing web sites and applications much easier with its built in code. Similar to that of AngularJS that I've been studying this week, Backbone and AngularJS seem to be opposites for particular areas. AngularJS uses the view to derive behavior whereas Backbone uses behavior to derive the view. Backbone is a great way to organize your code when building applications or working with ajax. In order to use Backbone.js, you will need to download and install at least three sources of code: </p>

                <h3> "MVC" (Model-View Controller) & Backbone </h3>
                <p> A Model-View Controller enforces a separation of business data, which refers to the "model." It also separates the user interface (the view) as well as the user input (the controller). Backbone uses this model by having an architecture similar to that of a Model-View Controller. The "view" in Backbone will take on the role of the "controller." The logic/user input will be stored here. Templates also take on the role of the "view." The view reflects what the application's data model will look like as well as events. With that being the case, the aesthetics will be stored within the templates.</p>
